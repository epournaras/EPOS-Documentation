Logging & Output
================

The logging functions in EPOS are extensive and they track, record, and report information about the system at each iteration and also at the end / termination of the simulation. The class implementations can be found at ``agent.logging`` package in the code. In order to initialise and add different loggers to the agent, they need to be added in the ``experiment.MultiObjectiveIEPOSExperiment`` class:

.. code-block:: java

  LoggingProvider<MultiObjectiveIEPOSAgent<Vector>> loggingProvider = new LoggingProvider<MultiObjectiveIEPOSAgent<Vector>>();        
  GlobalCostLogger<Vector>              GCLogger  = new GlobalCostLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getGlobalCostPath());
  LocalCostMultiObjectiveLogger<Vector> LCLogger  = new LocalCostMultiObjectiveLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getLocalCostPath());
  TerminationLogger<Vector>             TLogger   = new TerminationLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getTerminationPath());
  SelectedPlanLogger<Vector>            SPLogger  = new SelectedPlanLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getSelectedPlansPath(), config.numAgents);
  GlobalResponseVectorLogger<Vector>    GRVLogger = new GlobalResponseVectorLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getGlobalResponsePath());
  PlanFrequencyLogger<Vector>           DstLogger = new PlanFrequencyLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getDistributionPath());
  UnfairnessLogger<Vector>              ULogger   = new UnfairnessLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getUnfairnessPath());
  GlobalComplexCostLogger<Vector>       GCXLogger = new GlobalComplexCostLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getGlobalComplexCostPath());
  WeightsLogger<Vector>                 WLogger   = new WeightsLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getWeightsPath());
  ReorganizationLogger<Vector>          RLogger   = new ReorganizationLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getReorganizationPath());
  PositionLogger<Vector>                PLogger   = new PositionLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getAgentsMappingOderPath(),Configuration.numAgents);
  HardConstraintLogger<Vector>          HCLogger = new HardConstraintLogger<Vector>(Configuration.getHardConstraintPath(),Objects.equals(Configuration.constraint, "HARD_COSTS"));

        
  GCLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);
  LCLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);

  SPLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);

  GCXLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);
  WLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);
  RLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);
  PLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);
  HCLogger.setRun(Configuration.permutationID);


        
  loggingProvider.add(GCLogger);
  loggingProvider.add(LCLogger);
  loggingProvider.add(TLogger);

  loggingProvider.add(PLogger);
  loggingProvider.add(HCLogger);


In order to add / develop new loggers to EPOS, the ``GlobalCostLogger`` template is recommended. In addition to this, each logger, when their ``print`` function is called, they write their data on output files with address defined in ``config.Configuration`` class.

Global Complex Cost Logger
==========================

The global complex cost logger is implemented in ``agent.logging.GlobalComplexCostLogger.java`` and by default, it record the complex cost defined in :ref:`multi-objective-optimization-chapter`. The output file is named ``global-complex-cost.csv`` and can be found in this path: ``~/output/``. The .csv file is an matrix showing **complex cost** of the whole system, at each iteration, and across multiple runs. In addition, it shows the mean and standard deviation of the cost across different runs. By default, the *complex cost* (:ref:`multi-objective-optimization-chapter`) is defined as:

.. math::

   \gamma \cdot G^{(t)} + \alpha \cdot U^{(t)} + \beta \cdot L^{(t)}

Global Cost Logger
==================

The global cost logger is implemented in ``agent.logging.GlobalCostLogger.java`` and by default, it records the global cost defined in :ref:`multi-objective-optimization-chapter`. The output file is named ``global-cost.csv`` and can be found in this path: ``~/output/``. The .csv file is a matrix showing the **global cost of the whole system, at each iteration, and across multiple runs**. In addition, it shows the mean and the standard deviation of the global cost across different runs. If no specific global cost logger is defined at the ``config.Configuration`` then EPOS assigns ``GlobalComplexCostLogger<Vector> GCXLogger`` as the global cost logger.

Global Response Logger
======================

The global response logger is implemented in ``agent.logging.GlobalResponseCostLogger.java`` and by default, it records the global response defined in :ref:`global-cost-function-chapter`. The output file is named ``global-response-cost.csv`` and can be found in this path: ``~/output/``. The .csv file is a matrix showing **global response** of the system, i.e. the sum of all selected plans, for every EPOS repetition and in every iteration.

Indexed Histogram Logger
========================

The index histogram logger is implemented in ``agent.logging.PlanFrequencyLogger.java`` and by default, it records the plan frequency defined in :ref:`input-plans`. The output file is named ``indexes-histogram.csv`` and can be found in this path: ``~/output/``. The .csv file is an matrix showing **how many times each plan was selected** at the end of each run / simulation.

Local Cost Logger

The output file is named ``local-cost.csv`` and can be found in this path: ``~/output/``. The .csv file is a matrix showing **local cost of all agents** at each iteration and for every EPOS repetition. In addition, it shows the mean and the standard deviation of the cost across different runs.

Reorganization Logger

Hard Constraint Logger

This logger is implemented in ``agent.logging.HardConstraintLogger.java`` and by default, it records whether the global response (if hard constraints for plans) or the costs (if hard constraints for costs) violate the hard constraints for every EPOS repetition and in every iteration: **1** is violation, and **0** is no violation. The output file is named ``hard-constraint-violation.csv`` and can be found in this path: ``~/output/``.
