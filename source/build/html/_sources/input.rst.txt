Plans
=====

Plans are the representation of agents' possible actions. In EPOS, the plans are in form of n-dimensional vectors, which are read from the datasets. In each dataset, each agent has a certain number of plans, and each plan will have a certain of dimensions. A typical plan format is:

 *planScore* : *planDimension1*, ... , *planDimensionN*

in which the plan score can be:

1. discomfort (:ref:`local-cost-function-discomfort`) of the plan, or
2. preference (:ref:`local-cost-function-preference`) of the plan


The possible dataset formats are defined in ``agent.dataset`` package in the code. In addition, there is a Gaussian plan generator in ``agent.dataset.GaussianDataSet.java``. For this dataset, you can define the *number of agents*, *number of plans*, and *number of dimensions* using the configuration or the :ref:`arguments-chapter`.

In addition, at each iteration of EPOS, agents select their preliminary plans and report them to their parent. The implemented classes for this can be found at ``agent.planselection`` package. The main class is ``MultiObjectiveIeposPlanSelector implements PlanSelector<MultiObjectiveIEPOSAgent>`` and the main function is:

.. code-block:: java

      int id =  agent.getOptimization().argmin(agent.getGlobalCostFunction(), 
                                               agent.getLocalCostFunction(),
                                               agent.getPossiblePlans(), 
                                               otherResponse, 
                                               agent.getUnfairnessWeight(),
                                               agent.getLocalCostWeight(),
                                               currentDiscomfortSum,
                                               currentDiscomfortSumSqr,
                                               agent.getNumAgents(),
                                               agent);

which return the id of the selected local plan. There are different ways of selecting the local plan, however by default EPOS chooses the plan with the ``PlanSelectionOptimizationFunctionCollection.complexFunction1``. The function works as the following: :math:`(1 - \alpha - \beta) \cdot global\_cost + \alpha \cdot unfairness + \beta \cdot local\_cost`, the details of which can be found in :ref:`multi-objective-optimization-chapter`.

.. _input-incentive-signals:

Incentive Signals
=================

EPOS is able to guide the selections of agents towards a certain predefined goal. The goal is given as a reference incentive signal, and the agents make selections towards the best matching between their joint selections and the reference signal. As EPOS is a minimization algorithm, the objective is the minimization of *dissimilarity* between them. For more information on the dissimilarity measures, please see :ref:`global-cost-function-chapter`. The incentive signal is taken into account only if one of the following global cost functions are employed: :ref:`global-cost-function-cross-correlation`, :ref:`global-cost-function-rss` or :ref:`global-cost-function-rmse`.

The Incentive signal is used within EPOS via the parameter ``goalSignalPath`` by setting **a path** to a file containing the incentive signal. If the file path is not provided, a first ".target" file in *dataset* directory will be used as a goal signal. If none ".target" files are found, a *zero* goal signal is constructed (a signal filled with zeros).

Note that the incentive signal **must** be of the same length as plans. If it is shorter than the ``planDim`` parameter, it will be padded at the end in a Round-Robyn fashion, if longer, it will be cropped. The signal is given in a column, one value in each row. The file **cannot** have any headers or more than one column.

For example, the following are correct ways of providing the incentive signal to EPOS:

.. code-block:: java

   goalSignalPath="/home/user/Documents/EPOS-project/datasets/incentive-signal.csv"   // full path
   goalSignalPath="datasets/incentive-signal.csv"                                     // relative path

or in ``Configuration.java`` class:

.. code-block:: java
   :caption: Configuration.java
   :name: goal-signal-configuration-java

   public static String	goalSignalFilename = "/home/user/Documents/EPOS-project/datasets/incentive-signal.csv";  // or
   public static String	goalSignalFilename = "datasets/incentive-signal.csv";


And these are the incorrect ways:

.. code-block:: java

   goalSignalPath="datasets"                                                      // the name of the directory containing the file is invalid
   goalSignalPath="/home/user/Documents/EPOS-project/datasets/incentive-signal"   // the file extension must be specified

.. _input-hard-constraint:

Hard Constraint
=================

EPOS is able to set hard constraints for both plans and costs of agents. When setting the hard constraints, agents will select the plans that do not violate the constraints. If more than one plan satisfies, agents will choose the one following the soft constraints, i.e., the plan with minimum global complex cost. If no plan satisfies, agents will choose the plan that they choose in the last iteration.

The hard constraint for plans is used within EPOS via the parameter ``HARD_PLANS`` in ``constraint``, and via ``constraintPlansPath`` by setting **a path** to a file containing the hard constraint. The file has the dimension same as the ``planDim``, and at least **two** rows. The first row indicates the values of hard constraints for plans, each is for the corresponding dimension of the global response. The second row indicates the decision for plans, where **0**: ignore constraints, **1**: no larger than constraints, **2**: no less than constraints, **3**: equal to constraints. If setting a **range** constraint (upper and lower bound of hard constraint for plans), the file should set **four** rows, two (values and decisions) for upper and two for lower.

The hard constraint for costs is used within EPOS via the parameter ``HARD_COSTS`` in ``constraint``, and via ``constraintCostsPath`` by setting **a path** to a file containing the hard constraint. The file has two rows, one for values and the other for decisions, same as the above. And the file has three columns: **local cost** (1st column), **global cost** (2nd column) and **global complex cost** (3rd column).

Both of the hard constraint files, for example, are provided correctly as follows:

.. code-block:: java

   constraintPlansPath="/home/user/Documents/EPOS-project/datasets/hard_constraints_plans.csv"     // full path
   constraintPlansPath="datasets/hard_constraints_plans.csv"                                       // relative path
   constraintCostsPath="/home/user/Documents/EPOS-project/datasets/hard_constraints_costs.csv"     // full path
   constraintCostsPath="datasets/hard_constraints_costs.csv"                                       // relative path
